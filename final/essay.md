## How do I crack the coding interview?

Cameron and Ishaan forget how to do coding interviews! Drats!

Please write a short, step-by-step guide explaining how to do a coding interview. Make sure to tell us what to do when we get stuck in an interview! Because we are super lost, it would be awesome if you could tell us what some common mistakes on interviews are.

This is out of **20 points**, but we are not getting too specific with the rubric, as we want to see what you've learned from the class!

**[10]** Steps of an interview

**[6]** What to do if I get stuck?

**[4]** Two Common Pitfalls (for example, you should not write code before verbally discussing the solution - do not use this in your text)

Please submit your explanation in the zip file as a **pdf**.

__HINT: Check out rubrics from HWs, midterm, and final. Also, lecture 1 slides could be useful.__
